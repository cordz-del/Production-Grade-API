## Overview

This repository provides a complete, production-grade REST API that integrates advanced AI models like GPT-4 and Anthropic Claude. Built with Express.js, the API demonstrates:

- **Production-Grade API:** Wrapping complex AI models into secure, scalable services.
- **Integration & Scalability:** An end-to-end solution complete with robust authentication, error handling, and input validation.
- **Industry-Relevant Design:** A cohesive system that integrates multiple AI components to deliver high-quality responses enriched by contextual data.

## Features

- **API Endpoints:**
  - `/api/generate` – Generates AI responses based on user queries.
  - `/api/auth/register` – Handles user registration with full validation.
  - `/api/auth/login` – Authenticates users and issues JWT tokens.
  - `/api/context` – Retrieves contextual data to enrich AI responses.
- **Framework:** Built using [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for a lightweight, flexible, and scalable server solution.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI.
- **Error Handling & Validation:** Robust middleware to ensure only valid requests are processed.
- **Security:** JWT authentication, proper CORS configuration, and best practices for secure communication.

## Architecture

The system is divided into several key modules:
1. **Authentication Module:** Provides user registration, login, and token-based authentication.
2. **AI Integration Module:** Wraps calls to GPT-4 and Anthropic Claude for enriched AI responses.
3. **Context Retrieval Module:** Interfaces with a vector database (or other data sources) to fetch relevant contextual data.
4. **API Gateway:** Routes requests and handles errors, ensuring a scalable and maintainable architecture.
